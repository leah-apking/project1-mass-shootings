## Background 
We are taking a closer look at mass shootings in the United States over the last 8 years (2015-2022). Has that really become a more frequent issue? Do community factors such as poverty rate or population density impact the frequency of mass shootings? Are restrictive guns laws in blue states effective in limiting mass shootings?

## Background 
We are taking a closer look at mass shootings in the United States over the last 8 years (2015-2022). Has that really become a more frequent issue? Do community factors such as poverty rate or population density impact the frequency of mass shootings? Are restrictive guns laws in blue states effective in limiting mass shootings? Are mass shootings more common in red or blue states? Are mass shootings more common to occur in a certain season? 

## Data Sources

### Research questions
  1. Have the rates of mass shootings increased in the last 8 years?
  2. Does local poverty rate/ lower median family income contribute to greater prevalence of mass shootings in the US?
  3. Do gun laws impact the prevalence of mass shootings?
  4. What percentage of gun violence is related to mass shootings?
